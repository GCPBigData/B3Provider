This project is intended to provide a way to access public availabe data of the B3 Stock Exchange (former BMF & Bovespa).

## Motivation
Try to provide a little organization to the mess of all sorts of files into a generic and comprehensive framework to be incorporated into client apllications of all sorts.

## Code style
Please keep the observed current code style. Don't use your creativity here, put it somewhere else. I am sure you will find it pretty easy to follow.
